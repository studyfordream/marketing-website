## Site Localization and Inheritance Structure

### Previously we discussed some sort of potential ineritance structure

[Directory Structure](http://cl.ly/image/300F0x3Q1X3D)
- sorry I tried to link this as an image but markdown wasn't working for me :neckbeard:

#### Most Important
- Inheritance structure allowing for a built directory for each locale domain.
- Ability to create custom pages per locale.

#### Nice to Haves
- Content swap/overwriting based upon locale. (custom content)
- Partial injection/overwriting per locale. (custom layouts)

#### Considerations
- Build times not becoming overwhelming when dev'ing on not 1, but 5 sites
- Lots of other things that I'm not thinking of right now
