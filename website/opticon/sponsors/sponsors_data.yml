        description: "Based in Austin TX, Clearhead is the leading full service digital optimization agency and Optimizely’s top Solution Partner in North America.  In just under three years, we’ve modeled a new kind of 'upside down' agency - one built by former eCommerce, product, and digital execs from major brands and retailers.
          Clearhead’s goal is simple: deliver significant ROI via A/B testing, personalization, and web analytics strategy and execution.
            Our client-side experience helped fine tuned a process we’ve now offered over two-dozen Internet Retail 500 and B2C lead-gen clients. We begin by defining hypotheses designed to move the needle, put them through the paces, and finish by reporting elegant, executive-friendly data stories that not only achieve buy-in, they transform long-term company culture.
            Are you trying to jump start your program? Contemplating a major site re-design and want data to drive process? Join the Clearhead experiment.  <a href='http://clearhead.me/' target='_blank'>clearhead.me</a>"
