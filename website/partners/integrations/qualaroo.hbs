COMPANY

Qualaroo gives marketers a complete solution for collecting and acting on visitor insights to improve website performance. Powered by unobtrusive on-site surveys, Qualaroo collects voice of customer feedback that can be used to drive conversion rates. 

INTEGRATION

The Optimizely and Qualaroo integration enables personalized user experiences by using Qualaroo survey feedback to associate website visitors with Optimizely Audience segments. Instead of a generic site experience, you can show visitors relevant messages, content and experiences based on answers they’ve given to Qualaroo surveys on previous site visits.
