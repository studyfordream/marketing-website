##### Company

Amplitude's mobile & web analytics platform helps product and marketing teams drill down on user behavior and drive growth. In addition to standard analytics functions like tracking actions, funnels, and retention, Amplitude’s platform produces real user insights via data science tools like behavior-based cohorting to truly understand the drivers of growth.

##### Integration

Track Optimizely experiments and variation names directly in your Amplitude data. Optimizely will automatically populate an Amplitude User Property to all events triggered for a particular user. Measure the impact of your experiments by segmenting your Amplitude funnels, retention, etc. by variations your users were exposed to.
