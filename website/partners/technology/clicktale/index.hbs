##### Integration

Integrating ClickTale with Optimizely will help you to answer the following questions:

•	What should I test?

Instead of guessing what elements on the page influence customer behavior, first watch Visitor Playback and analyze Heatmaps to identify what changes will have the greatest impact.

• Why did one version convert better?

Run post-test analyses with ClickTale to uncover how the changes you made impacted your visitors’ behavior.

• Based on the results, what should I test next?

 Get inspired with fresh ideas for future tests based upon your visitors’ behavior.

 Make use of these key features:

•True-to-life™ Recordings – ClickTale’s Session Playback replicates the exact version of HTML as seen by each visitor to your site. This gives you an accurate view of each of your visitors’ online experience.

•Visual Heatmaps – Analyze different versions of the page and uncover how visitor behavior is influenced revealing the reasons why one version performed better than another.
