##### Company

Lotame is the data management platform (DMP) for Maximum Audience Impact—helping marketers, publishers and agencies maximize the way they collect, unify, protect, and activate audience data. Lotame leverages an audience management engine to intelligently monetize data, create premium properties, target more efficiently, and drive higher campaign performance and revenue. Lotame is dedicated to constant innovation and helping clients take full advantage of big data.


##### Integration


Lotame DMP and Optimizely clients have a unique combination of DMP and website optimization tools that they can use to easily satisfy consumer demand for rich, relevant and personalized content.

Lotame’s rich audience data segments are imported into Optimizely to deliver actionable insights into visitor behavior.  This data allows customers to define Optimizely Audiences, which in turn, allow customers to analyze their results and target their experiments by otherwise unavailable attributes.
