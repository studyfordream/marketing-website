##### Company

Ptengine is a user-friendly heatmap and web analytics platform that empowers web development, marketing and UI/UX teams to improve online businesses for more conversion and sales.

Ptengine also offers click, attention, scroll-reach and click analysis heatmap technologies to help customers understand visitor behavior. Ptengine collects and analyzes data from desktops, smartphones and tablets which allows customers to manage all their data in one platform.

##### Integration

The Ptengine integration allows joint customers to use click, attention, scroll-reach and click analysis heatmaps to:
1. Quickly find out what page elements to test in order to carve out an effective testing plan, without guessing.
2. Visually understand how visitors’ behavior in various active experiments are affected by changes to a website.
3. Try new ideas to test until you get the best results based on visitor behavior.

Ptengine heatmaps support websites built with responsive design.
